## Login - Signup - Logout

Here we have used PHP for backend with MySql database and bootstrap library for frontend. We have also used a hashing algorithm which is  providing our database safety from hackers.
Along with this we do not allow two users to be able to sign in using the same username. It will give errors. 
We are planning to add an appointment page instead of a welcome page which is under process. The page will allow users to maintain a profile page as well as appointment time will be shown to the users whenever doctor will be ready to take appointment.
